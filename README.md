## Releases

The software is a part of the `CommServer` software family. It was written by CAS Lodz Poland. `CommServer` is a package of software to manage data transfer. The software implements algorithms and uses technologies that provide smart data transfer over the network. To learn more about `CommServer` software family visit the [software home page][comsvr].

I was the founder and Executive Director of CAS. Now CAS is just an individual business activity conducted by me, so I decided to move this software to Open Source.
